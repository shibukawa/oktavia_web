============================================

Thanks for your business! Here's an overview of what this ZIP file contains:

README.txt
	The document you're currently reading.

html/ (+)
	Contains the standards compliant XHTML/CSS version of the template, including
	all required layout files (.html), stylesheets (.css), images (.jpg, .gif, .png)
	and JS where applicable (.js). If you're planning to use this version of the
	template, these are the files you'll want to edit and upload to your website.

	If you're using an older HTML editor or one that lacks adequate support for CSS,
	you may have issues using this version of the template. If that's the case,
	and the template includes legacy layouts (see below), use those instead.

	(+) Only included with templates that feature standards-compliant layouts.

html_legacy/ (+)
	Contains the legacy tables-based version of this template, including all required
	layout files (.html), stylesheets (.css), and images (.jpg, .gif, .png), and JS
	where applicable (.js). If you're planning to use this version of the template,
	these are the files you'll want to edit and upload to your website.

	(+) Only included with templates that feature legacy layouts.

psd/
	Contains the Adobe Photoshop source files (.psd) for each of the layouts included
	with this template. You can edit these to make more extensive changes to the
	template's graphics, but you don't have to actually upload them to your website.

	Note: These files are "sliced" using Photoshop's built-in slicing tool, and both
	the standards compliant layouts and legacy layouts share the same Photoshop source
	files and slices.
